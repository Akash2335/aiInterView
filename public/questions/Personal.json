This directly reduced manual reconciliation efforts by 30%. I also architected the secure JWT authentication and Role-Based Access Control, ensuring the protection of sensitive customer data.\n\nBeyond new features, I've taken ownership of system performance and reliability. By optimizing complex SQL queries, stored procedures, and functions, I was able to boost performance for high-volume transactions by 25%. Furthermore, I've resolved over 100 client-reported issues, which significantly improved system stability and client satisfaction."
