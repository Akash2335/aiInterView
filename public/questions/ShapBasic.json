      "question": "2. What are the four pillars of OOP?",
      "answer": "Answer: 1. Encapsulation – Hiding internal details of objects and exposing only necessary functionality. 2. Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features. 3. Inheritance – Allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. 4. Polymorphism – Allowing objects to take multiple forms."
